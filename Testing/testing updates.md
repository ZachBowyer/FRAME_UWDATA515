# Project notes -

Website -
1) Page is too linear and narrow, doesn’t render well on a computer
2) Allergies doesn’t have a "No Allergies" option
3) Rephrase "enter" to select unless we have to enter text
4) Price range should have $ sign
5) "Miscelleaneous Preferences:" should have none selected option
	a. Also, Miscellaneous is spelt wrong
6) The map should display a  pin or person icon to show the zipcode I selected
7) We also need a list of restaurants displayed, or are we just going to show it on the map?
8) Need a recenter option on the map 
9) Overall the site should be a one pager at best , users rarely are happy to scroll through pages
