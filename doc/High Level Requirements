The main requirements for this website will be -
  1) User uses filters that align with their needs in terms of food items that they are looking for.
  2) The result displays 5 food items based on the selection - these 5 items need not be from the same restaurant. 
  3) The result displays 3 links - the restaurant website(if available), further (all) menu items from the restaurant and the google maps directions.  
 
 Features to consider -
  1) User tracking and storing data of inputs and outputs
  2) Further 5 results if the first 5 weren't appetizing enough
  3) Search by restaurant and rank their hits
  4) If we are storing data, we can develop a recommender system based on user profile and inputs
  5) Track hits of restaurants/menus
  6) Create multiple views - customer, restaurant owner, website developers/debuggers
